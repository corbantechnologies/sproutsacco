// Flow

// Member applies for loan: In Progress. Here they can update the loan application.
// Member submits for amendment Application status changes to Ready for Amendment.
// Admin amends loan application: Application status changes to Amended.
// Member reviews amendment. Can accept or reject
//      If accepts: status changes to In Progress if loan is not fully covered. Here they apply for guarantors; if they accept and fully cover, it changes to Ready for Submission or it changes to Ready for Submission if loan is fully covered.
//      If rejects: status changes to Rejected. Application ends here
// Once status is Ready for Submission, member submits the loan application for approval.
// Admin reviews the loan application. Can approve or decline.
//      If approves: status changes to Approved. Loan application ends here.
//      If declines: status changes to Declined. Loan application ends here.
// A Disbursed loan application is a loan that has been disbursed to the member. No further action can be taken on it.
// Status changes are automatically done by the system except for the following:
//      1. Member accepting or cancelling amendment.
//      2. Admin approving or declining loan application.
